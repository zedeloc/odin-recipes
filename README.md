# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is a modest project to practice basic HTML website design.

Skills focused on:

    Use of appropriate folder structures
        - Webpages and Resources in their respective folders
            * Use of short names
            * Populate folders "css" and "js" even if unused
        - index.html in root folder
    
    Employ newly learned HTML Elements and Attributes
        - <p> <h> <strong> <em>
        - Use <a> tags to allow multi-page navigation
            * Assure "noopener" and "noreferrer" attributes used in alignment with best practices
            * Place one 'target="_blank"' attribute for practice, possibly in footer
                (use theodinproject.com as a "created with the help of TOP" link)
        - Use <img> tags to add images
            * Assure "alt" attributes are used in alignment with best practices
        - Use ordered and unordered lists for recipe links <ul>, ingredients <ul>, and instructions <ol>
